## About üí°

On September 1st, 2022, GitHub [announced](https://github.com/community/community/discussions/31644#discussion-4354090) that it will be deprecating the `/trending` page. Many GitHub users (myself included) really enjoy the trending page. It is a great way to discover new repositories, projects, and developers.

This project is an attempt to recreate the trending page in a way that is open source and community driven. The goal is to be able to preserve a feed of trending repos that can be used by anyone, regardless of which direction GitHub chooses to go with the `/trending` page

### How it Works üî®

This project has two main components:

- The **data**
- The **website**

#### The Data üìä

All data which is used to generate the trending data is from [gharchive](http://www.gharchive.org/) which is an open source project to collect a history of all GitHub events.

A GitHub Action cron runs once an hour to collect all data from the previous hour from gharchive and stores that data in a SQL database (PlanetScale free-tier).

From here, the second phase of the Action workflow kicks off which aggregates all the events from the database in time slices (1 day, 1 week, 1 month, and all time). This data is then enriched with repository and contributor information from GitHub's API.

Once we have enriched data, it is sent to an S3 bucket in JSON format and those files are served by Cloudflare's CDN all around the world

#### The Website üåê

> Wow the website looks *just like GitHub*! Is it GitHub?

Even though the website looks very similar to GitHub, it is not GitHub at all! In fact, GitHub open sourced their entire CSS design system called [Primer](https://primer.style/). They have also been releasing React componets for Primer as well and that is exactly what this website is built with!

In short, this website is a React app that uses Primer components and the data from the data pipeline to generate the trending page.
